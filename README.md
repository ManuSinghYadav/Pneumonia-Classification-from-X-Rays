## COVID-19 Xray Dataset Dataset Overview

The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) exhibits several distinctive features. While diagnosis is confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), individuals with pneumonia resulting from the infection may display patterns on chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images that are moderately characteristic to the human eye (Ng, 2020). The transmission rate of COVID-19 is contingent upon our ability to accurately identify infected patients while minimizing false negatives. Furthermore, a low incidence of false positives is imperative to prevent overburdening the healthcare system by subjecting individuals to unnecessary quarantine. Coupled with effective infection control measures, timely detection of the disease is crucial for promptly implementing the required supportive care for COVID-19 patients.
